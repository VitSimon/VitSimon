Application development is a long-term deal and is one of my hobbies. A relatively long period, what programming and application development to devote've gone through a number of technologies (Delphi, MS.NET Framework, Java) and development tools (Borland Delphi, Embarcadero RAD tools, Visual Studio, Visual Studio.NET). These experiences have taught me to think about assignments as algorithms from a general perspective and regardless of the technology used. In the specific implementation technology, and then I am trying to find effective solutions using the possibilities that the technology offers for development.
